# The iterative learning gain that optimize teal time torque tracking for Ankle exoskeleton in human walking under gait variation

## Good sentences

+ Lower-limb exoskeletons often use torque control to manipulate energy flow and  ensure human safety.
+ The accuracy of the applied torque greatly affects how well the motion is assisted and therefore improving it is always of interest
+ Being able to reduce interface impedance, increase the reactiveness of robotic systems and thus improve human safety and comfort (Haddadin et al., 2008; Lasota et al., 2014), torque control has been widely used in physical human-robot interactive systems.
+  Torque control enables easy manipulation of energy flow from the robot to the human, which is one major research interest in the field of biomechanics.
+ Therefore, improving torque control performance has always been an active  interest in the field of lower-limb human-robot interactive systems.
+ Due to the presence of complicated, time-varying, and highly non-linear human  dynamics, interaction dynamics and transmission dynamics, a fixed accurate  system model was neither easy to get nor very meaningful due to the fast changes  of system mechanical properties when human walk.
+ This control architecture ignored the complicated and changing system dynamics  caused by humanrobot interactions and transmission frictions
+ tracking capability, stability and steady-state error manipulation are all managed. τ, τdes and eτ = τ − τdes are the measured exoskeleton torque, the desired torque and the torque error, respectively. 

为什么不使用直接的力矩控制

因为做不到。这种类似SEA 的控制只能通过改变位置实现对力矩的追踪。该AFO所施加的力矩于subject运动状态密切相关。所以没有办法之家相加。或者说他的关节力矩无法测量

思考的不对
