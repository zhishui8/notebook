The mean CoP position of **LEA patients** generally **veered towards the non-amputated side** (1.1 ± 0.3 cm), whereas the **healthy** controls was only **slightly towards the dominant side** (0.2  ±0.1 cm). **Higher CoP velocities were found in LEA** patients than in healthy controls [11,25,28]. Additionally, the **non-amputated side** also showed **greater amplitudes of CoP along the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial- lateral (ML) direc**tions [18,24]

## **conclusion:**

Moreover, the actual balance contribution of each leg was not tightly coupled to weight bearing in each leg, as was the case in healthy controls. 

there was a significant positive correlation between the prosthetic ankle stiffness and the dynamic balance control





# Trunk accelerometry as a measure of balance control during quiet standing



**another approach is to choose a surface reference point in the proximity to where COM is believed to be during quiet standing, and estimate the movements of COM relative to this point** [12–14]. A reference point moving parallel to the COM would have the same displacement, velocity and acceleration as COM. The error of choosing a surface reference point is therefore restricted to the changes in the position of this point relative to the COM.

**Horizontal acceleration of COM is therefore a body sway measure of considerable theoretical interest.** 

accelerometry  has been widespread 

One obvious source of variability is the gravity component registered by a  measuring axis that is not horizontal. Such tilt may be caused by the curvature  of the lower back and by the inconsistency in the positioning of the device.  Procedures have been suggested to eliminate constant inclination of the  measuring axes, either by correcting the tilt mechanically before a trial is  performed [24] or by calculating the average tilt trigonometrically based on the  acceleration data obtained during a trial [23].



# Biomechanical assessment of quiet standing and changes associated with aging

**cognitive impairment, abnormality of balance and gait ** 

Sheldon 4 first suggested that the ability to control sway in the advancing  years may result in falls

the mechanical criterion for stability of stance is maintenance of the CoG over the BoS.

measure of COG var(variability) show significant increase for the age

The inverted pendulum model is inadequate for describing the motions of  a multiple link system

because the COP traces represent the sum of all the inertial and voluntary forces, this measures is potentially more sensitive to subtle differences in performances than is the CoG

Stelmach and Worringham 26 reviewed the role of sensori motor deficits in the  aged with respect to falls. They concluded that the numerous deficits  associated with aging result in limitations of both perception and execution of  a movement.

injurious falls ,the woman make more frequent ML weight shift than man.

Older subjects seem to reduce the small continuous movements associated with younger subjects in favor of larger adjustments that probably involve more **trunk and hip motion**

when stability is sudden or severely compromised, the required high levels of muscle activity may represent high levels may represent a serious neuromuscular challenge that the elderly are unable to meet. Slowing, coupled with changes in postural control strategy, may prevent quick  and timely recovery from internally generated or externally encountered postural  pertubations.

## COP based measurements

root mean-square error (RMS), COP range, COP path length, mean COP velocity, COP  amplitude, mean or median power frequency, sway area, and fractal dimensions.

##  kernel description

These results suggest that the elevation of the body COM from a lower to a  higher position systematically decreases the postural control during quiet  standing, and consequently, increases the intensity of the balancing task. Thus,  this type of physical manipulation could provide the basis for a simple  progression in functional resistance training for persons with compromised  balance





# Aging, muscle activity, and balance control: physiologic changes associated with balance impairment

## **Measurements**

**traditional **measures of COP displacements and **stabilogram-diffusion** 

## interesting finding

+ high levels of muscle activity are a characteristic of age-related declines in postural stability and that such activity is correlated with short-term postural sway

+ Elderly fallers demonstrated significantly greater amounts of sway in the antero-posterior (AP) direction and greater muscle activity during quiet standing compared with the young subjects, while elderly non-fallers demonstrated significantly greater muscle activation and co-activation compared with the young subjects
+ greater postural sway in both the AP and medio-lateral (ML) directions and trends of greater muscle activity were found in those older adults who demonstrated lower scores on clinical measures of balance. In addition, short-term postural sway was found to be significantly correlated with muscle activity in each of these groups

## Useful knowledge

In 1993, Collins and De Luca [6] developed a statistical-biomechanics method of assessing quietstanding foot center-of-pressure (COP) time series, called **stabilogram-diffusion analysis (SDA)**. This analysis revealed that over short-term time intervals during quiet stance, the COP tends to drift away from a relative equilibrium point, while over long-term time intervals, the COP tends to return to a relative equilibrium point [6?/8] (postural control system utilizes **open-loop control mechanisms** over the short-term and **closed-loop control mechanisms over the long-term** to maintain upright stance.)

Moreover, compared with healthy young adults, older adults exhibit significantly  increased levels of muscle co-activation in response to postural perturbations  [12].

This indicates that co-activation of these muscles had a stabilizing effect on short-term postural sway



others information

We hypothesized that age-related increases in postural sway during short intervals of time was due, in part, to an age-related increase in muscle activity during quiet standing

older has higher TA activity ,**Weakness in these muscle groups could potentially impair an individual’s ability  to correct a shift in the body’s center of gravity and effectively prevent a  fall. It may be that maintaining these muscles in an activated state, thereby  increasing muscle co-activation, is an attempt to provide additional stability  under conditions of increased muscle weakness.** 

Age-related deterioration of sensory and neuromuscular control mechanisms may  also be responsible for the greater muscle activity of the elderly subjects.  Increasing levels of muscle activity may assist in enhancing joint  proprioception by increasing the firing rate and recruitment of primary  afferents, thereby enhancing the functional behavior of the associated  closed-loop postural control mechanisms

**time delay due to sensing, transmission, processing and muscle activation was  increased**

Newman et al. [25] found that postural stability was optimal within a range of  muscle activity, and very large amounts or very small amounts of muscle activity  created postural instability

It is unknown, however, whether increased muscle activity is a contributing  factor to increased postural sway or whether increased muscle activation is a  compensation for increased postural sway



ML balance is controlled mainly by a ‘load/unload’ mechanism,  i.e., simultaneous loading of one limb and unloading of the opposite  limb by hip lateral muscles.

balance control process

+ acquisition of sensory information
+ its processing in the central nervous system 
+ body movements through effectors

, sensory information is necessary for the postural control. The sensory information about posture and kinesthesia feeds the postural control to build a postural frame of reference
